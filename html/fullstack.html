                on my phone plan, I decided to keep up with the action by creating a program that sends myself text messages
                every time there was a goal in the World Cup. Hosted on Heroku, this was one of my first projects that integrated a backend environment,
                and it really got me started with Node.JS. It was during this project that I realized how truly limitless programming can be;
                Twilio sent the text messages, Firebase stored the data to ensure duplicate messages weren't sent out, and a big shoutout to
                the creator of the worldcup.sfg.io API. This was one of my more fun hobby projects that ended up sending messages to most of my friends and
                some family as well.</div>

                hooked me up with my first signed contract work in August 2018. They wanted a replica of their current quiz made with Adobe
                Experience Design, with a few extra features. I was thrilled to have my first paid programming work, and I got good at a few new
                API's on the way, including integration with Google Sheets, PDFKit, and Firebase Cloud Storage. Learning how to make PDF's, write to spreadsheets,
                and uploading files to cloud storage will definitely be useful for later projects. Also, this is the first real project I made after reading
                "Clean Code" by Robert Martin, so my code quality increased significantly. On the right is an iframe with the adult version of the quiz
                embeded for you to take!

                 the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript down. It took me only a couple hours, but ended up being shaded and textured really nicely.
                This is where I realized not only how little I knew about design back then, but how insanely customizable every single little
                element is in CSS; the importance of the translateY on active to make the buttons look like they're really being pressed is so simple yet important. </div>
