                    live in Berkeley. Implementing MapKit, Braintree, Firebase, and a few other third party API's was a breeze, although
                    we are currently looking for a designer so we can clean up our UI UX a little more.

                    to tap on two points in 3D space and displays the 3D distance between them in meters. It was a relatively simple app to
                    build, but I use it multiple times a week. Apple released a substantially more feature rich version in iOS 12,
                    but I like using the version I made – food always tastes better when you cook it. The second app is an AR
                    dice app that rolls 3D rendered die on any surface.

                    and was my first app learning about asking for user permissions and calling an API. On the right is a
                    bitcoin price app that shows the price of bitcoin in a few different currencies; I'm pretty into cryptocurrency
                     and blockchain.

                    brothers bought me when they asked if I could learn Swift to make them an app. Although that project fell
                    through, I stuck with the course, and began with these two simple, hardcoded apps. The one on the left is a
                    Xylaphone that plays different tones per color, and on the right is a general knowledge quiz that introduced
                    me to cocoapods. I had no idea how much I had yet to learn back then – these seemed like huge feats at the time.
